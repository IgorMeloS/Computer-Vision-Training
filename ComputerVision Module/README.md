# Computer Vision Module (compvis)

This folder contains two others folders. I present the Computer Vision Module in the folder compvis, a pipeline to simplify the code process. This module contains some sub-modules, according with the necessity, as neural networks, for example. The folder Practical Examples contains examples using the the module to apply the CNN's models for some different dataset.

The Computer Vision Module (compvis) is organized by sub-modules, each sub-module contains a certain number of class. The main structure is gave as:

-[compvis](https://github.com/IgorMeloS/Computer-Vision-Training/tree/main/ComputerVision%20Module/compvis) module
  -[datsets](https://github.com/IgorMeloS/Computer-Vision-Training/tree/main/ComputerVision%20Module/compvis/datasets) sub-module
      -[SimpleDatasetLoader](https://github.com/IgorMeloS/Computer-Vision-Training/blob/main/ComputerVision%20Module/compvis/datasets/simpledatasetoader.py) class
  -[preprocessing] class
