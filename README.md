# Computer Vision Training

This project is a part of my personal training in Computer Vision. Here, we can find two folders, Computer Vision Module (compvis) and OpenCV. The compvis module is a pipeline build any model practically. It’s covered in the module several CNN architectures, and also, some skills for image data load and preprocessing (this module is based on the [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) module, all credits are to the author, even if I did modifications).

The OpenCV folder contains some important skills for computer vision tasks. The OpenCV library is mandatory to computer vision (CV), being the most popular free library for CV. From the image preprocessing to the model applications, OpenCV offers to us straightforward and practical tools.

If you want to know the contents in each folder, you can access them by the follow hyperlinks:

- [OpenCV](https://github.com/IgorMeloS/Computer-Vision-Training/tree/main/OpenCV)

Feel free to comment and make critics, your feeling about this project is welcome.

## Datasets

The examples considered here, are trained with classical datasets as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CALTECH, ILSVRC, COCO, Kaggle challenges datasets, and others. All of them are cited in each project, we can also find the link to download the respective dataset.

## References


Along the project, I cite the papers that refer models or techniques, in the proper moment. I also would like to highlight the importance of the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), that offers to us many possibilities to learn practically (sometimes free or not, but always in the web). I’ve used many of them in this project as

- [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) offers to us free examples for real applications in computer vision.

- [Learn OpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/) website specialized about OpenCV.

- [Nicholas Renotte](https://www.youtube.com/c/NicholasRenotte), great YouTube channel with examples and advice, one of the best.

- [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/) is  an excellent website that proposes several practical examples for Machine Learning projects in your blog.

- [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp) YouTube channel with code examples about technical courses.
