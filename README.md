# Computer Vision Training

This project is a part of my personal training in Computer Vision. Here, we can find two folders, Computer Vision Module (compvis) and Practical Examples. The compvis module is a pipeline that builds any model practically. It covers several CNN architectures, and also, some skills for image preprocessing.

The compvis module is inspired by the [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) module, so the credits for this module is to the author of the website Adrian Rosebrock. How did I have access to the module? I've grabbed this repository on GitHub [1](https://github.com/Sid2697/pyimage-Learning) and I found this website [2](https://blog.csdn.net/zimiao552147572/article/details/106718957#t1), all of them contain the module. Why did I change the name of module? During my training, typing line by line to understand the module, I've decided to change the name of the module, and also, some modifications in the module (name changing and including class), for a questions of simplicity and coding preference.

The folder Practical Example contains examples how to use the module. As I'm not enrolled at PyImageSearch, I should follow the examples from [1](https://github.com/Sid2697/pyimage-Learning). The problem was, in this repository there's no explanation how to use the module, neither discussion about the results. I learned how to use it by myself and reading the PyImageSearchâ€™s blog. To understand each model, I did a deep reading about the papers of each model. Each example presented here is followed by a model explanation, discussion about the results and evidently, a detailed explanation of how to use the module.

## The Practical Examples

The practical examples follow a logical order. Using the compvis module, We start from a simple image classifier into the most advanced. Each folder presented in the Practical Examples corresponds to a specific model or techniques (image preprocessing, learning rate scheduler, regularization etc). Several datasets are considered along the examples, all of them are cited, due to a space limitation, I did not up load the datasets, but you find the link to download all of them in the proper moment.

9 - [Transfer Learning with Fine Tuning](https://github.com/IgorMeloS/Computer-Vision-Training/tree/main/Practical%20Examples/9%20-%20Transfer%20Learning%20with%20Fine%20Tuning)

Image classification using transfer learning. We consider the fine-tuning method using a VGG16 pre-trained model. The training process is made in two step. The first step is the feature extraction and classification made by a defined head function, in this moment the weights from VGG16 are not tweaked. The second step the head function communicates with some layer from the body, realizing the fine-tuning over the weights from the pre-trained model. We've considered the 17 Flowers dataset, the accuracy was 95%, a considerable increase. On the other hand, the model seems in over-fit.

Training the Mini GoogLeNet on the CIFAR10 and, Deeper GoogLeNet on the Tiny ImageNet dataset. The results with the Mini GoogLeNet on CIFAR10 show an accuracy of 91% on training set, the best result until now, using this module. The results on Tiny ImageNet was also good, we've obtained an error rate of 0.55, a good result for the Tiny ImageNet challenge, not the best, but convicently. We also used the HDF5DatasetGenerator to read the images on the batch instead of allocate all images on the memory.

## References

Along the project, I cite the papers that refer models or techniques, in the proper moment. I also would like to highlight the importance of the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), that offers to us many possibilities to learn practically (sometimes free or not, but always in the web). Iâ€™ve used many of them in this project as

- [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) offers to us free examples for real applications in computer vision, the best website about Computer Vision.

- [Learn OpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/) website specialized about OpenCV.

- [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/) is  an excellent website that proposes several practical examples for Machine Learning projects in your blog.

**Keep in mind, the best sources are always the original papers of each Convolutional Neural Network model. From them, we can understand better the idea behind each model**.
