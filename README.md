# Computer Vision Training

This project is a part of my personal training in Computer Vision. Here, we can find two folders, Computer Vision Module (compvis) and OpenCV. The compvis module is a pipeline to aid us to build any model practically. It’s covered in the module several CNN architectures, and also, some skills for image data load and preprocessing.

The second folder contains some important skills for computer vision tasks. The OpenCV library is mandatory to computer vision (CV), being the most popular free library for CV. From the image preprocessing to the model applications, OpenCV offers to us straightforward and practical tools.

If you want to know the contents in each folder, you can access them by the follow hyperlinks:
- [ComputerVision Module](https://github.com/IgorMeloS/Computer-Vision-Training/tree/main/ComputerVision%20Module)
- [OpenCV](https://github.com/IgorMeloS/Computer-Vision-Training/tree/main/OpenCV)

Feel free to comment and make critics, this is very important, your feeling about this project.

## Datasets

The most of the examples considered here, are trained with classical datasets as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CALTECH, ILSVRC, COCO, Kaggle challenges dataset, and others. All of them are cited in each project, we can also find the link to download the respective dataset.

## References


Along the project, I cite the papers that refers models or techniques, in the proper moment. I also would like to highlight the importance of the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), that offers to us many possibilities to learn practically (sometimes free or not, but always in the web). I’ve used many of them in this project as

- [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) offers to us free examples for real applications in computer vision. There’s also the possibility to purchase full coursers (we can download them, even if it's not cool, but here is the web. We found sources everywhere. If you can to purchase, it's always even better).

- [Learn OpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/) website specialized about OpenCV.
- 
- [Nicholas Renotte](https://www.youtube.com/c/NicholasRenotte), great YouTube channel with examples and advices, one of the best.

- [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/) is  an excellent website that proposes several practical examples for Machine Learning projects in your blog. The website offers also books about many subjects in Artificial Intelligence (if you can buy it, is better than grab a copy).

- [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp) YouTube channel with code examples about technical courses.
